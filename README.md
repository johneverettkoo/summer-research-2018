# 2018 Summer Research Project

## Summary:

* Proof of the equivalence of ratio cut and k-means on a 1-dimensional 
embedding for k = 2
* Illustration of the shortcomings of the relaxed approach to ratio cut via 
spectral embedding
* Counterexample for the equivalence of ratio cut and kernel k-means for the 
MP-inverse of the combinatorial Laplacian
* Explorations of various ratio cut and kernel k-means solvers
